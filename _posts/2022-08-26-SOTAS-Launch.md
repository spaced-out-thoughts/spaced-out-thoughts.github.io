Today we officially announce the launch of the Spaced Out Thoughts Aeronautical Society.

## Mission

In order for inter-planatary travel to be successful, space vehicles must be able to obtain fuel outside of Earth and certainly beyond the initial 
payload, post launch. SOTAS will establish fueling hubs on conveniently located satellites to aid space exploration, asteroid cultivation, and 
expansion of life beyond earth. 

## Stages to Success

### Moon Fueling Station

Given its proximity to Earth, the moon is a logical first location for a fueling station.

[ ] earth bound relay hub
[ ] launch SOTAS hub satellite around Earth for middle tier relay
[ ] round trip to moon with autonomous vehicle
[ ] drop off base payload on moon establishing communication with middle tier relay
[ ] successfully mine fueling substance and use to launch own vehicle back to Earth
[ ] minimal, self-sustaining  base station for autonomous miner workers on moon
[ ] moon docking and fueling station
